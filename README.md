# Elegant + BodyBuilder

Elm library to write type safe html (BodyBuilder), with inline styles compiled to CSS (Elegant) under the hood. You can find an example [here](https://elm-bodybuilder.github.io/elegant/).

```elm
import BodyBuilder exposing (..)
import Elegant exposing (textCenter)


view model =
    div [ style [ textCenter ] ] [ text "I'm Elegantly styled by css, but my style is set inline" ]


main : Program Basics.Never number msg
main =
    program
        { init = ( 0, Cmd.none )
        , update = (\msg model -> ( model, Cmd.none ))
        , subscriptions = always Sub.none
        , view = view
        }

```
