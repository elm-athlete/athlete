# Athlete

Athlete is a **native looking** app builder for elm !

Elegant.elm and Bodybuilder.elm are the underlying parts of your athlete

## Athlete - build your app, **one function at a time â„¢**

### Start with bodybuilder views (muscle)
![Bodybuilder](readme/bodybuilder.png)

### Add some elegant styles (almost all the css spec is built in, in a type safe way)
![Elegant](readme/elegant.png)

### Create your router : your views are now part of an app !
``` elm
type CatRouter
  = CatsIndex
  | CatShow Id
```

### Use (or implement) transitions between your views !
![Transitions](readme/transitions.png)

### You are done ! You can know deploy your app on the app store and the android store (and the web)

### But there's more, a lot more... you can create so many other [things](https://elm-bodybuilder.github.io/elegant) with Athlete.
