# Elegant + BodyBuilder

Elm library to write type safe html (BodyBuilder), with inline styles compiled to CSS (Elegant) under the hood. You can find an example [here](https://elm-bodybuilder.github.io/elegant/).

# Why should I use Elegant + Bodybuilder, and how it compares to elm-css ?

Elegant takes the approach of removing on purpose the css abstraction from the developer, but it uses css under the hood to style elements.

When I create a bodybuilder div with the style `textCenter`, bodybuilder goes all over the bodybuilder tree and get all the styles, and then compiles them into a single style node on top of the generated html with the class `.text-center` with the value `text-align: center;`. In the resulting html, we then have `<div class="text-center"></div>`.

The css is totally dynamic, and is only here to style the generated html.

We could say it's a virtual css object model. We don't write css, we only write inline style, and for performance and capabilities of css, we use css.

ðŸš¨ If you are looking for an abstraction over css, look at elm-css, they do it very well.

For us, css is an abstraction of the past, and we don't need it anymore.

BodyBuilder is also an abstraction over elm-html that makes html creation Type Safe.

What we mean by that is that if you write something like `h1 [href "https://google.com"] [text "google"]`, it doesn't compile, because h1 is not a `a` element.

BodyBuilder also prevent html mistakes, like putting `button` inside `a`.

But the most impressive thing of BodyBuilder is that it allows the use of elegant.

Look at the demo folder for more impressive elegant and bodybuilder demos.

# How ?

```elm
import BodyBuilder exposing (..)
import Elegant exposing (textCenter)


view model =
    div [ style [ textCenter ] ] [ text "I'm Elegantly styled by css, but my style is set inline" ]


main : Program Basics.Never number msg
main =
    program
        { init = ( 0, Cmd.none )
        , update = (\msg model -> ( model, Cmd.none ))
        , subscriptions = always Sub.none
        , view = view
        }

```
